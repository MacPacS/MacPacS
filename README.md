👨‍💻 Hi there! I'm a dedicated programmer with a love for problem-solving and creating innovative solutions through code. 
My main focus is on Python 🐍 and JavaScript 💻, but I’m always eager to explore new languages and technologies.
I thrive in Linux 🐧 environments, where the power of open-source fuels my creativity and productivity.
When I’m deep into coding, you’ll usually find me sipping on a cup of coffee ☕ or tea 🍵 the perfect companions for long coding sessions. 
Whether it's building web applications, automating tasks, or tinkering with new tools, programming is more than just work for me it's my passion!
